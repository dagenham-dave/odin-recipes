    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Frozen salmon fillets are so economical, but I often forget to defrost them! 
        This recipe calls for adding frozen salmon fillets directly to your Instant Pot® 
        for a perfectly cooked fillet in mere minutes. I finish the salmon under the 
        broiler for just 2 minutes with a honey-mustard glaze on top. Delicious!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 fillets frozen salmon fillets</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup water, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Season frozen salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Place a trivet inside 
                a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and pour in 1 
                cup of water, ensuring the water does not cover the trivet. Place fillets 
                skin-side down on the trivet in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's 
                instructions; set timer for 4 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to 
                build.</li>
            <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to 
                manufacturer's instructions immediately after cooking time is over, about 
                5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix together honey, mustard, and olive oil in a small 
                bowl.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the 
                oven's broiler to high. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Unlock and remove the Instant Pot® lid. Carefully transfer cooked fillets 
                onto the prepared baking sheet, skin-side down. Spread 1/2 of the 
                honey-mustard glaze over each fillet.</li>
            <li>Broil salmon fillets for 2 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
