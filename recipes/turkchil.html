    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It doesn't get easier than this! Brown some meat, then toss in the rest of the 
        ingredients and hit start! Feel free to adjust the heat level by adding more 
        chipotle peppers and/or adobo sauce. The cocoa powder and cinnamon are ideas 
        I got from my favorite chili seasoning available at a local spice shop - they 
        really transform the dish! I like to top this with sour cream, green onion and 
        shredded smoked cheddar.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, oregano, cocoa powder, 
                    cumin, cinnamon, coriander, and black pepper in a small bowl. 
                    Set seasoning mix aside.</li>
                <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) 
                    and select Saute function. Heat olive oil over high heat and brown 
                    ground turkey until crumbly, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and jalapeno 
                    and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, kidney beans, 
                    tomato sauce, chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, and seasoning mix. 
                    Mix to combine, scraping up any browned bits off the bottom of the 
                    pot. Close and lock the lid.</li>
                <li>Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; 
                    set timer for 20 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to 
                    build.</li>
                <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according 
                    to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove 
                    the lid. Stir chili and adjust salt, if desired. Serve with your 
                    favorite toppings.</li>
